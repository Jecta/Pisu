# Pisu

Pisu is a simple tool that generates the first part of a Discord user token by encoding a user ID. Please note that this tool is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be used to violate Discord's Terms of Service or engage in any malicious activities.

Please note that the generated token is incomplete and cannot be used as a valid Discord user token. It is purely for demonstration purposes and should not be shared or used for any malicious activities.
